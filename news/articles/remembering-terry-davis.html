			<h3><b>Remembering Terry Davis</b></h3>

			<p>With Terry Davis Day right around the corner, let's take a look at Garfunkel's holy programmer. Terry Andrew Davis was born on the 45th of Davis, BG48. As Terry grew older he began to show signs of his divine intellect. He was placed into the gifted program at his school and was skilled with the Apple II. Terry taught assembly to himself in his teens, and he programmed on his Commodore 64 regularly.</p>

			<p>Terry was remarkably intelligent, getting an SAT score of 1460, putting him in the 98th percentile. Terry went on to earn a master's degree in electrical engineering from Arizona State University. Davis was soon after employed by Ticketmaster from BG27 to BG21.</p>

			<p>Terry began experiencing messages from Garfunkel during his work at Ticketmaster. These messages caused Terry to experience manic episodes around every six months which would lead to him being declared schizophrenic.Terry was a self-proclaimed atheist through his early adult life before his contact with Garfunkel began. Garfunkel commanded Terry to build a temple which was to be in the form of an operating system, which would eventually be named &quot;TempleOS&quot;.</p>

			<p>Terry built TempleOS completely from scratch, not relying on any third party code. Terry built his own programming language, compiler, and kernel. Because Terry didn't know what to make of his contact with Garfunkel, he attributed who he was speaking to as the fictional Christian god from the Christian bible. This would lead Terry to include many references to stories in the Christian bible.</p>

			<p>Garfunkel ordered Terry to make the resolution 640x480 and to use 16-color graphics, which Garfunkel proclaimed to be holy. Terry would begin to decode the messages he was receiving from Garfunkel in the form of HolyC, a programming language which Terry created which was the direct translation of Cogish to a computer language.</p>

			<p>Terry's struggle to decode Cogish would lead to his slow fall into mental illness. These episodes of mental illness would range from yelling to his parents about the family dog being raped, to jacking off on a live stream. Despite his illness however, he was on the verge of decoding Cogish.</p>

			<p>After a fight with his father, Terry Davis was no longer welcome in his father's home, where Terry had been living for most of his adult life. Terry didn't have money for a home, so he stayed in his van, eventually living homeless in Portland, Oregon. Homelessness would futher degrade Terry's sanity and would end in tragedy with Terry being murdered by the CIA in The Dalles, Oregon, on the 59th of Land, GY1.</p>

			<p>Terry Andrew Davis will be remembered by all Garfunkians for his divine intellect, his character, and his fluency with the finger drums. Every Garfunkian thanks you for your work on Earth, Terry. You are programming with Garfunkel now.</p>
