			<h3><b>The Solution Fallacy</b></h3>
			<h5>C14-GY3</h5>
			<h5><i>Zachary Dawson</i></h5>
			<img src="nigger-crime.jpg"/>
			<div><p>The solution fallacy is the false assumption that there is a (logical) solution to the problem. The truth is, not every problem has a solution. Note that this fallacy does not take into account irrational and illogical plans. One such nonsensible plan to eliminate crime would be to kill everyone, therefore nobody will be around to commit crime.</p></div>
			<div><p>To use this in an argument, you would merely say “your plan commits the solution fallacy. The truth is, we just have to deal with the problem.”. You could also bring up a counter-plan to not solve the problem, but mitigate it in some way. </p></div>
			<div><p>Some people think that there is a solution to every problem. Some things are apart of nature. Man can not challenge nature. Everything was made by Garfunkel. Garfunkel can not be controlled by man. If every problem had a solution, we would be in an idealistic world. We all know that idealism is stupid.</p></div>
			<div><p>One example is a plan to eliminate crime. A plan to eliminate crime commits the solution fallacy. Therefore, it is destined to fail. Another example is imaginary numbers. Rafael Bombelli committed the solution fallacy. He, like many, saw that there was no square root of -1. That is it. There is no square root of -1. The third example is racism. There is nothing we can do to stop racism. A “plan” to stop racism does not exist.</p></div>
