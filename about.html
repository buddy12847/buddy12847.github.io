			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>Garfunkel created the Earth and the Heavens, and created his children, mankind, to occupy the Earth. Garfunkel gave his children his Holy Book, which includes over a thousand laws, observations, and words of inspiration which were created to guide his children towards a fulfilling and happy life and to protect them from degeneracy. <p>
			<p>Garfunkel's 522nd Law states that "Garfunkel loves his children, which is why he has given his Earth to them, for that is the Law of Garfunkel." Garfunkel cares deeply about all of his children and has a plan for every one of them. Garfunkel is very understanding and gracious, no one is too far gone to be saved by Garfunkel's never ending love.</p>
			<p>Garfunkel gave his children the nation of Garfunkia so they could be free to live in accordance with Garfunkel's laws and guidance without the restrictions placed upon them by foreign peoples. Garfunkia is ruled by Garfunkel's six grandchildren who comprise the High Council, which is the vessel of Garfunkel's will on Earth. </p>
			<p>You can read Garfunkel's laws and the Holy Book of Garfunkel on the resources page.</p>
