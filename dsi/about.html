			<h2>About</h2> 
			</hr>
			<p>Garfunkel created the Earth and the universe, and created his children, humans, to occupy the Earth. Garfunkel gave his children the Holy Book of Garfunkel which included hundreds of laws, observations, and words of inspiration which were created to guide and protect Garfunkel's children from harm and degeneracy. <p>
			<p>Garfunkel loves his children, Law 522 states, "Garfunkel loves his children, which is why he has giveth the Earth to them, for that is the law of Garfunkel." Garfunkel cares deeply about all of his children and has a plan for every one of them. Garfunkel is very understanding and gracious, no one is too far gone to be saved by Garfunkel's never ending love.</p>
			<p>Garfunkel gave his children the nation of Garfunkia so they could be free to live in accordance with Garfunkel's laws and guidance without the restrictions placed upon them by foreign peoples. Garfunkia is ruled by Garfunkel's six grandchildren who occupy the High Council given to them by Garfunkel. </p>
			<p>You can read Garfunkel's laws and the Holy Book of Garfunkel on the resources page.</p>
